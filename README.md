2018 AOC solutions 

I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenge in 2018. All of the code is in Python (3). 
To see the original puzzle, visit the AOC site linked above.

The version posted here has been lightly cleaned up -- removing debug lines, improving the spacing, adding a few comments -- 
but it's mostly still code that was written against a clock.
