2018 AOC solutions 

I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenge in 2018, using Python.

The code posted here has been lightly cleaned up -- removing debug, improving the spacing, adding a few comments -- 
but it's mostly still code that was written against the clock.
